# Quantitative-redox-biology-calculating-glutathione-synthesis
### Description
This repository corresponds to our paper titled: "**10 cheat codes-like ways to measure oxidative stress in humans**". The repository contains the R code and  data used for the quantitative analysis presented in the 10th 'cheat code' of the paper. In this quantitative example we used a minimal model, based on Huang et al (2021), to calculate glutathione synthesis under two different nutritional scenarios: i) N-acetylcysteine supplementation; and ii) dietary cysteine deficiency.
